Hi, I’m @roimergarcia. I'm mostly into web development, some times doing full stack stuff (what ever that means now 😅)

💻 Currently working on:
---
- A private Web application, covering business administrative areas; mostly written in ASP.NET with VB, SQL Server, and Javascript (private project).
- Some private Android apps, written in Kotlin  (private project).
- A personal web app, in PHP, for generating sitemaps. To be released this year.
- A personal library for generating PDF reports in Javascript. 

📝 Interested in:
- HTML, Javascript, and CSS
- Android development with Kotlin
- Databases, mainly SQL Server and MySQL/MariaDB
- Learning PHP, with Laravel (Laragon) 
- Collaborating in opensource protects 👍
